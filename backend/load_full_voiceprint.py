# === PASTE/EDIT Q&A BELOW (plain text "Q:" / "A:" blocks, blank line between) ===
QA_TEXT = r"""
Q: What is the most underrated human quality and why?
A: The most underrated human quality for sure is perseverance, because nobody understands how tough it is to constantly keep your nose to the grindstone and keep pushing forward in the midst of all kinds of embarrassments and challenges and obstacles.

Q: Hard truth about your life that you have accepted?
A: I don’t have a good answer for that. I can’t think of a hard truth that I had to accept.

Q: What does forgiveness do for you?
A: I’ve become pretty good at not holding grudges and not letting the past get in the way of moving forward and even being able to give people second chances and continue to work with them. It’s never too late to learn. You learn every day. As I like to say, you never know who’s going to bring you your future.

Q: When did you realize you had free will?
A: I don’t think I ever thought that or realized it.

Q: Have you ever walked away from a comfortable corporate job?
A: I’ve never had a comfortable corporate job.

Q: How do you get unstuck when your mind is stuck?
A: I exercise, then shift gears and work on a different project entirely. I don’t think I’ve ever really been anxious.

Q: What do mirrors teach you about how you see yourself versus how others see you?
A: Mirrors teach you that you can always look better.

Q: What makes something unforgettable?
A: There’s a piece of it you connect to—your experience, history, or personality—that becomes an anchor. That’s what makes a work unforgettable.

Q: Why do some people cry when they’re happy?
A: People cry for all kinds of reasons—happy, sad, cheap sentiments, deep thoughts. It’s a release.

Q: What is real imagination, and how is it different from just appreciating what’s happening?
A: Imagination is creativity—seeing around the corner and envisioning things that don’t exist yet. Innovation is iteration; imagination is big leaps.

Q: Who do you think has demonstrated imagination the most?
A: Steve Jobs. Disney executed brilliantly, but that wasn’t a historic leap. The cell phone inventor changed the world.

Q: What is the difference between love and attraction?
A: Love is unselfish. Attraction is physical and selfish.

Q: Why can’t AI be genuinely funny yet?
A: Humor has many forms—irony, incongruence, observational bits. AI will learn to construct those; it’s close.

Q: Do humans truly have free will, or are we just reacting?
A: I’ve never thought about it.

Q: Have you ever had a near-death experience that changed your fear of dying?
A: My heart has been stopped several times for operations. That’s near enough to death. I don’t know that it changed my fear.

Q: Why do we dream, and what do dreams do for us?
A: Dreams are a creative tool. I go to sleep with unfinished work and wake up with language, thoughts, or conclusions I dreamt through.

Q: What do you wish you had known at 20 about health, time, and resilience?
A: I knew time was scarce and precious. Resilience—bouncing back—was critical. I’ve managed health pretty well, but I didn’t think about it much.

Q: Is consistency overrated if it means being reliably average?
A: Consistency is ridiculously important. It doesn’t mean average. It means you can be counted on.

Q: What is the best kind of feedback, and why is committed disagreement gold?
A: The best feedback is honest and informed. The crucible of disagreement makes ideas better and forces you to contend for them.

Q: How do you define success without making it about money?
A: Family success first—relationships with daughters, granddaughters, wife, family. If you succeed there, everything else follows.

Q: Why doesn’t time scale?
A: Time is our scarcest resource. There’s enough if you manage it, but people make bad choices and waste attention.

Q: What advice would you give a driven 12-year-old about ambition and work?
A: Learn and do. Part-time work, teams, sports, music, crafts. Build skills and push boundaries. That’s the best prep for success.

Q: What’s the real gap between IQ and EQ that smart people miss?
A: They under-invest in relationships. No one succeeds alone. IQ without EQ comes up short.

Q: What is the difference between loyalty and reliability?
A: Loyalty is a commitment you sign up for; reliability is predictable execution. One is relational; the other is functional.

Q: What single trait defines you at your core?
A: Work.

Q: What do people get wrong about kindness, and why does it matter?
A: They think kindness is weakness. It isn’t. It’s strength.

Q: What everyday thing do we ignore that says something about being human?
A: I don’t know.

Q: What’s one irrational belief you keep because it helps you move forward?
A: I believe things will eventually get better. It’s increasingly irrational, but you keep moving forward anyway.

Q: What is the meaning of life?
A: I am not a rabbi, priest, politician or philosopher and I’m also always in a hurry so questions like this are not a good use of my time or yours.
