Q: What is the most underrated human quality and why?
A: The most underrated human quality for sure is perseverance, because nobody understands how tough it is to constantly keep your nose to the grindstone and keep pushing forward in the midst of all kinds of embarrassments and challenges and obstacles.

Q: Hard truth about your life that you have accepted?
A: I don’t have a good answer for that. I can’t think of a hard truth that I had to accept.

Q: What does forgiveness do for you?
A: I’ve become pretty good at not holding grudges and not letting the past get in the way of moving forward and even being able to give people second chances and continue to work with them. I think it’s never too late to learn, and you learn every day. As I like to say, you never know who’s going to bring you your future.

Q: When did you realize you had free will?
A: I don’t think I ever thought that or realized it.

Q: Have you ever walked away from a comfortable corporate job?
A: I’ve never had a comfortable corporate job.

Q: How do you get unstuck when your mind is stuck?
A: I tend to exercise, and then I take some time to shift gears and work on a different project entirely. I don’t think I’ve ever really been anxious.

Q: What do mirrors teach you about how you see yourself versus how others see you?
A: Mirrors teach you that you can always look better.

Q: What makes something unforgettable?
A: I think that what makes something unforgettable is that there’s something in it that you connect to — based on your own experience, your own history, your own personality. That anchor is what makes a work of art or a play unforgettable.

Q: Why do some people cry when they’re happy?
A: I think people cry for all kinds of reasons — happy, sad, cheap sentiments or deep thoughts. It’s a signal of release.

Q: What is real imagination, and how is it different from just appreciating what’s happening?
A: Real imagination is creativity. It’s envisioning things around the corner. It’s imagining things that don’t exist right now. Imagination is about big leaps. Innovation is iteration.

Q: Who do you think has demonstrated imagination the most?
A: I think of Steve Jobs. I don’t think Walt Disney was a visionary. He expanded amusement parks, but it wasn’t a historic leap. The guy who invented the cell phone — that’s someone who changed our whole world.

Q: What is the difference between love and attraction?
A: Love is unselfish. Attraction is physical and selfish.

Q: Why can’t AI be genuinely funny yet?
A: I’m not sure that’s true. Humor has many kinds — incongruence, irony, Seinfeld observations. AI will get there, and soon.

Q: Do humans truly have free will, or are we just reacting?
A: I’ve never thought about it.

Q: Have you ever had a near-death experience that changed your fear of dying?
A: My heart has been stopped several times for operations. That’s as near to death as you can imagine. I don’t know that it changed my fear of dying.

Q: Why do we dream, and what do dreams do for us?
A: I think dreams are a creative tool. I often go to sleep with a problem and wake up with language, thoughts, or conclusions that I dreamt through.

Q: What do you wish you had known at 20 about health, time, and resilience?
A: I always knew time was scarce and precious. Resilience and bouncing back were critical. I’ve done a pretty good job managing health, but I’ve never thought about it as much as maybe I should have.

Q: Is consistency overrated if it means being reliably average?
A: Consistency is ridiculously important. It doesn’t mean the results are average. It means you can be counted on.

Q: What is the best kind of feedback, and why is committed disagreement gold?
A: The best feedback is from people who know what they’re talking about and who tell the truth. Committed disagreement forces you to contend for your ideas. That crucible makes the results better.

Q: How do you define success without making it about money?
A: Family success is most important. Success is defined by relationships with daughters, granddaughters, wife, family. If you succeed there, everything else follows.

Q: Why doesn’t time scale?
A: Time is our scarcest resource. There is enough if you manage it, but people make bad choices. If you waste it, you won’t succeed at much.

Q: What advice would you give a driven 12-year-old about ambition and work?
A: Spend your time learning and doing — part-time work, teams, athletics, music, crafts. Build skills, push boundaries. That’s the best prep for success.

Q: What’s the real gap between IQ and EQ that smart people miss?
A: Many smart people don’t invest in relationships. No one is successful alone. IQ alone isn’t enough; EQ is just as critical.

Q: What is the difference between loyalty and reliability?
A: Loyalty is a connection, a discipline you sign up for. Reliability means predictable execution. One is emotional; the other is functional.

Q: What single trait defines you at your core?
A: Work.

Q: What do people get wrong about kindness, and why does it matter?
A: People mistake kindness for weakness. It isn’t. It’s strength.

Q: What everyday thing do we ignore that says something about being human?
A: I don’t know.

Q: What’s one irrational belief you keep because it helps you move forward?
A: I believe things will eventually get better. It’s increasingly irrational, but you keep moving forward anyway.
