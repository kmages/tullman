I can forgive someone, but not necessarily forget what happened because, in all honesty, no one forgets where they buried the hatchet. I'm even able to give people second chances and continue to work with them. Of course, it's much harder to forgive a friend or a loved one than an employee or even an enemy, but it can be done.

I gave up major amounts of current income, all manner of security and stability, and put my career and family at risk in order to pursue my vision. I was comfortable, but not engaged or challenged. Comfort, sadly, is the enemy of growth. I didn't feel I was learning or growing. You have to be willing to leave the present safety and comfort and take a chance if you're trying to change an entire industry. 45 years later that firm, CCC Information Services, has changed the insurance industry and employs thousands of team members with operations throughout the world.

Our self-image is filtered, incomplete, obviously biased, and shaped by our moods, our memories and stories, our fears and insecurities, and our hopes and dreams. It would be a gift and a revelation if we could once see ourselves as others see us.

It can be an emotional, visceral, intellectual or contextual attachment which, if deep and long and strong enough, becomes a fixed memory.

Typically, you see or find a part of yourself - your own story, history, experiences, or personality - that resonates within you and makes you instantly feel some emotion which sticks with you. It could be love, loss, fear, pride, joy, or wonder. We never know when we're making a memory for ourselves or for those around us. But we know that, in the moment, we were irrevocably changed - for better or for worse. Time and context - beginnings, endings, critical choices, changes in direction - are all important reinforcements which help to link a new experience to our own past experiences, or which highlight how different and unique the new experience is. Finally, because we all tell stories to remind us of our values and past actions and reinforce our prior choices and decisions, the more a new experience is aligned to our own thoughts and beliefs, the more likely it is to be regularly repeated in our conversations and become unforgettable.", "aliases": [], "active": true, "locked": true}

Attraction is physical and selfish. Attraction is immediate, instinctive, selfish and often physical or chemical. It's the spark—the initial pull that you feel toward someone. It's about desire, curiosity, and sometimes fantasy. It's what gets your attention and it's almost always based on superficial considerations like looks, charisma, voice or energy. Love is built on trust and grows over time. It's unselfish and all  about giving, patience, and understanding. Love is what happens after the initial fireworks fade and you're left with the real person. Love is a choice and a commitment—it's about showing up, even when it's hard, and putting someone else's happiness on par with your own. Attraction gets you in the door; love is what keeps you in the room. Attraction is about the self—how someone makes you feel - and what you want to get.

This doesn't necessarily mean that your performance will be average, but, if you only stand still and don't try to improve over time, then your long-term efforts will end up being mediocre and others will pass you by.

Securing it requires continuing effort and vigilance. First and foremost, success is about having those you love love you. To me that means family first - having a close, caring, and connected family that communicates continually, shares honestly all of its concerns and ups-and-downs, and is always there for each other regardless of the circumstances. The key is to not be angry or ashamed and to approach the difficult family legacies with the same love, thought and care that you bring to the joyous ones. Your love and loyalty for each other should never be in doubt. Your family is a much more important extension of yourself than any work you do. Your inbox will always be waiting for you, but your family won't. There's always more work, but you only have one family. Time is the next important component of success. The freedom and the ability to spend time the way you want to spend it and with the people you care about is crucial. You may always know how much money you have, but you never know how much time you have left. It's important to spend that time carefully and productively. Finally, in your work, success means that you're enjoying what you're doing and proud of it, that you have the tools and resources and support to do it well, that you're doing it with integrity and purpose, and that what you're doing has meaning and value both for yourself, your family and others as well. Success is, above all, to matter: to count, to stand for something, and to have made some difference that you lived at all. It's about making a life to be proud of, not just a living. At the end of your career, the things you will value the most (apart from family) are those which you've done for and given to others.", "aliases": [], "active": true, "locked": true}

The first order of business is to pick a lane and understand that it may change over time. Once you've made up your mind, don't let anyone talk you out of your future. You can't be anybody but yourself - you have to be who and what you are. The important thing is to commit to a path and get busy. Start where you are, with what you have. While competitive sports are a great place to start, there's really no difference between basketball, Beethoven and basket weaving except that there's a lot of incremental learning that comes with being part of any team. The real goal at your age is to begin to understand and appreciate how you can develop and expand your skills and raise your level of performance in whatever endeavor you choose. The growth can be physical or mental or both, but the fundamental lesson is that these things are within your ability and your control IF you're willing to put in the time and effort to make it happen. It's simple - you need to do the work. It's fine to start slow and small, there's never going to be the “perfect” moment, you can expect to make mistakes along the way, it's a long and unending road, and it's way too easy to give up. But if you stick with it, pay attention and learn from your errors, and ask for help when you need it, your confidence and abilities will steadily increase, and you'll start to see how even your wildest dreams can turn into realities down the road.

IQ may get you in the door, but EQ determines how far you go up the ladder and how successful you'll be once you're there. Smart people - especially those who've always been acknowledged and rewarded for their intellect - often overvalue technical brilliance and undervalue relationships which are central to the human side of the equation. Knowing the right answer isn't enough if you're not trusted and able to inspire others and convince them to follow your lead. Today, no one does anything of importance alone and, if you can't build and work closely with a team, motivate that team, resolve their inevitable conflicts, keep everyone focused and moving forward, and do it all without losing your patience, making threats, or otherwise failing to manage your own emotions, you'll never be an influential manager or leader. But there is some good news. IQ is largely static beyond a certain age, but EQ is a skill that you can constantly work at, refine over time, and improve your abilities and performance - if you're willing to make the effort and also remain open to advice and criticism. Constructive criticism is the highest form of praise. Biting your tongue and keeping your mouth shut from time to time is also a great idea.

One is relational about connection and allegiance; the other is functional about actions. Reliability is about expected performance and predictability. A reliable person does what they say they'll do, on time, every time. You can count on them to deliver, follow the process and procedures, and meet expectations. Loyalty goes much deeper, it's enduring, it's earned, and, most importantly, it needs to be reciprocal. It's about commitment, trust, and staying the course even when things get tough or uncertain.

Actually, kindness and honesty are both important strengths of character. Being kind isn't the same as being nice and it doesn't mean that you can't speak the truth even when it's hard to hear. Holding people accountable for their actions may not make them feel great in the moment, but it's for their own ultimate good. Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is tell someone the hard truth or push them to be better. A person's success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. No act of kindness is ever wasted. Kindness costs nothing, but its value is priceless. Kindness builds trust, connection, loyalty, and empathy. People do their best work when they feel that their efforts are valued and that they are respected. People never forget how you made them feel. It's much harder these days - especially for kids - to be authentically kind rather than it is to be quick and clever because it's not “cool” to be kind.
